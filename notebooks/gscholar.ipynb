    "By default, the code provides only the links to page containing independent citations, and does not open the page to count them.\n",
    "Google Scholar actively blocks automated requests to its citation database.\n",

    "Below are a few options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FreeProxy**: Use continuously changing proxies for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This protects your IP address, but is not very effective at circumventing Google Scholar's anti-bot prevention. You might want to use other options if you are unable to reach Google Scholar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ScraperAPI** (recommended): [Create a free account](https://www.scraperapi.com/) without providing personal and payment information. Free account supports 5000 requests per month, more that sufficient to run this notebook for most researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Luminati** (untested): Similar to ScraperAPI, and is known to circumvent Google Scholar's anti-bot prevention better. No free account is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SingleProxy**: Use a single proxy for all requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoProxy** (default): Using `NoProxy` will not fetch the counts by default. You can still try to fetch the counts (at your own risk) by setting `links_only` below to `False`. Use this sparingly if `FreeProxy` does not work and you don't want to create any accounts. You may also use this safely if you are already connected to a VPN.\n",
